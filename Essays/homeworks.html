		Here is my Mr. Macedo Homework on the 9/11 articles:

		<h3>9/11 Between our Feelings and Reality</h3> 
		<p>
		While John Updike took a descriptive tone of the horrendous day, that then led him to reach the conclusion that American freedom has taken a hit, Susan Sontag criticized whoever had that conclusion by countering it with the argument that this was in fact an attack on what she described as “the world’s self-proclaimed super-power” as consequence of certain American actions and alliances.  
		</p>
		<p>
		John Updike portrayed the day using his own first-hand-experience, as he was in an apartment in Brooklyn Heights. He recalled his memories of that day using both a terrified tone and traumatizing imagery. “We knew we had just witnessed thousands of deaths; we clung to each other as if we ourselves were falling.” The nightmare is still on, he proclaimed. As he started imaging the bodies under the rubble. Ultimately, he couldn’t bear the idea that peaceful passengers were used as a missile for war.

		He then criticized the openness that led to such horrible acts of war, an openness that damaged the American freedom. Yet, risk is a cost of freedom, he conceded. By extension, he saw this freedom worth fighting for, even if a few abuse it and turn it into a curse.

		Susan Sontag, on the other hand, was critical of the ideology that the attack was a hit on freedom. She accused the media and public figures of infantilizing the public by saying that the attack was a cowardly attack on “civilization” or “liberty” or “humanity” or “the free world”. On the contrary, she acknowledged that the attack was far away from coward. Moreover, she underscored the criticism by pointing to the American bombing in Iraq by writing, “and if the word “cowardly” to be used, it might be more aptly applied to those who kill from beyond the range of retaliation, high in the sky.”

		“Everything is not O.K.” she announced ironically. In the end, she suggested that there needs to be a new way to handle foreign policies, particularly in the Middle East, and acknowledged that those changes might be underway.
